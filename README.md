# Statistical Data Analysis

## Tutorials description
- [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/VinayFaria/Statistical_Data_Analysis/tree/master/tutorial_1) helps in getting familiar with programming languages usage, comparing data with mean and curve fitting using least square method.
- [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/VinayFaria/Statistical_Data_Analysis/tree/master/tutorial_2) helps in calculating some parameters using large data, plotting time graph.
- [Tutorial 3](https://github.com/VinayFaria/Statistical_Data_Analysis/tree/master/tutorial_3) helps in analysis of temperature data for NWH (North Western Himalayan) region.
- [Tutorial 4](https://github.com/VinayFaria/Statistical_Data_Analysis/tree/master/tutorial_4) helps in understanding simple linear regression, multivariate linear regression, simple non-linear regression, and multivariate non-linear regression
- [Tutorial 5](https://github.com/VinayFaria/Statistical_Data_Analysis/tree/master/tutorial_5) helps in building non-linear regression model from scratch.
- [Tutorial 6](https://github.com/VinayFaria/Statistical_Data_Analysis/tree/master/tutorial_6) helps in understanding clustering.

## Project description
Aim: Determining the homogeneous zone of the North West Himalayan region by employing a clustering method based on skewness and kurtosis features in temperature and precipitation data variation.
- Below plot is correlation plot (not a clustering plot) between rainfall and temperature. Clustering is performed using three methods DBSCAN, k-means, and hierarchical clustering, (code link)[https://github.com/VinayFaria/Statistical_Data_Analysis/tree/master/Project].
